 ## Submitting your work
 
-   Create a new branch called  **gh-pages**  and upload your local work into this branch.
-   Start a new  **pull request**, select one  **reviewer**  and make sure to put the  **GitHub Pages URL**  in the comment section.
-   Do  **not**  merge this Pull Request yourself. That's up to the reviewer to decide (merging is approving the assignment).
